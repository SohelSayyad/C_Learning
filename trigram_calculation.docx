Trigram Model Probability Calculation

Question: Compute P("I love NLP") for a trigram model

Given Probabilities:
• P(I) = 0.2
• P(love | I) = 0.4
• P(NLP | I, love) = 0.5

Solution:

For a trigram model, the probability of a sequence of words is calculated using the chain rule of probability:

P("I love NLP") = P(I) × P(love | I) × P(NLP | I, love)

Substituting the given values:

P("I love NLP") = 0.2 × 0.4 × 0.5
P("I love NLP") = 0.04

Answer: P("I love NLP") = 0.04

Explanation:
The trigram model calculates the probability of a word sequence by multiplying the individual conditional probabilities. This follows the chain rule where each word's probability depends on the previous words in the sequence.

• P(I) = 0.2 represents the probability of the word "I" occurring at the beginning
• P(love | I) = 0.4 represents the probability of "love" given that "I" precedes it
• P(NLP | I, love) = 0.5 represents the probability of "NLP" given that "I love" precedes it

The final probability of 0.04 (4%) indicates the likelihood of observing this specific three-word sequence according to the given trigram model.
